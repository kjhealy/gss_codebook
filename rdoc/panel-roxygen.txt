On each line the first word is in capital letters                  like BEAST. Then there are five other words. Tell me the number                 of the word that comes closest to the meaning of the word in                    capital letters. For example, if the word in capital letters is                 BEAST, you would say "4" since "animal" come closer to BEAST                    than any of the other words. If you wish, I will read the words                 to you. These words are difficult for almost everyone just give                 me your best guess if you are not sure of the answer. }

The next few questions are about the Arctic and the                       Antarctic. The Arctic is the region around the North Pole;                      Antarctic is the region that contains the South Pole. These                     questions are like ones you might see on a television game show.                If you don't know or aren't sure, just tell me so, and we will                  skip to the next question. e. Would you say the polar ice caps                  have gotten larger or smaller over the last 25 years? }
