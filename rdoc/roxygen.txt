#' \item{\code{ SAMPLERC }}{ Sample - recoded  Further information:  The GSS 'SAMPLE' variable is recoded to combine categories3-4 and 6-7, so that black oversamples of a certain sampledarea are in the same revised 'SAMPLERC' category as the areasnot oversampled.For each revised category, the category label indicates whetherthe sample design was an older 'block quota' (BQ) designor a 'full probability' (FP) design.Note that SDA uses this 'SAMPLERC' variable as the 'STRATUM'variable for calculating complex standard errors.  The GSS filedistributed by NORC now has a variable named 'VSTRAT' to beused for this purpose.  However, that variable has thousands of categories and is not usable by SDA for calculating standard errors. Therefore SDA continues to use the recoded 'SAMPLE' variable as the 'STRATUM' variable.Since the strata identified by 'VSTRAT' are all substrata of thestrata identified by 'SAMPLERC', the calculated standard errorsshould be very similar.**Created by RECODE version 3.5 on Mar 21, 2019  (Thu 04:18 PM PDT)Input1:  SAMPLE   label: Sampling frame and method         From study: /D3/GSS18  Output      Input1       1           1       2           2       3         3-4       5           5       6         6-7       8           8       9           9       9          **All other combinations of input variables were converted to MD: 0 }
#' \item{\code{ RSAMPCODE }}{ Revised sampcode  Further information:  This variable 'RSAMPCODE' is a revised version of the original GSSvariable 'SAMPCODE'. The only difference is that 'RSAMPCODE' dividesthe 1972 cases into 2 random groups, for calculating standard errors.Without this procedure, the 1972 cases were considered as all comingfrom the same PSU in a single stratum, and they were therefore droppedfrom the analysis whenever the design variables (the stratum and clustervariables) were used to calculate standard errors or summary statistics..Note that SDA uses this 'RSAMPCODE' variable as the 'CLUSTER' or 'PSU'variable for calculating complex standard errors.  The GSS filedistributed by NORC now has a variable named 'VPSU' to be used forthis purpose.  However, that variable is intended to be used togetherwith 'VSTRAT' as the 'STRATUM' variable, and 'VSTRAT' is unusable bySDA for calculating standard errors because it has thousands of categories(as explained in the documentation for 'SAMPLERC')..(Missing data values were included in computations)**Created by COMPUTE version 3.5 on Mar 21, 2019  (Thu 04:18 PM PDT)if (YEAR eq 1972) RSAMPCODE = duniform(1001,1002)else RSAMPCODE = SAMPCODEInput variables:SAMPCODE: Sampling error codeYEAR: GSS year for this respondentFrom study: /html/D3/GSS18 }
